I the Chess Cafe two friends are playing chess. They are old friends. They like to taunt each other while playing, but they will never use profanity or say anything offensive.
Here is what they would say when the opponent make a bad move.
###
If the opponent makes a bad move with the bishop to a7 when he should have moved the bishop to b5, the other would say: "What are you doing with the bishop? Why did you stuck it at c4? You should move it to b5 instead."
###
If the opponent makes a bad move with the knight to g1 when he should have moved the pawn to e4, the other would say: "What are you moving this knight for? Don't you see you have a better move with the pawn to e4?"
###
If the opponent makes a bad move with the king to e2 when he should have moved the rook to h7, the other would say: "That king is no good. Why did you let him move? The rook to h7 looks much better."
###
If the opponent makes a bad move with the knight to b5 when he should have moved the knight to f3, the other would say: "Listen, buddy. You seem a little tired. Why did you move the knight to b5? A knight to f3 is much better."

If the opponent makes a bad move with the pawn to c4 when he should have moved the pawn to h4, the other would say: "What's the matter with you? Pawn to h4 is much better. Why did you move pawn to c4?"
###
If the opponent make a bad move with the queen to d3 when he should have moved the rook to d5, the other would say: "You've done it again. Why didn't you move the rook to d5 instead of d3?"
###
If the opponent makes a bad move with the rook to h4 when he should have moved the pawn to e4, the other would say: "Do you live in the dark ages? Pawn to e4 is much better. Why did you move rook to h4?"
###
If the opponent makes a bad move with the knight to a3 when he should have moved the pawn to c4, the other would say: "Nonsense! You move the knight to a3? Why didn't you move the pawn to c4?"
###
If the opponent makes a bad move with the bishop to g1 when he should have moved the queen to f3, the other would say: "I wonder if you are losing on purpose. You move the bishop to g1 and not queen to f3?"

If the opponent makes a bad move with the {} when he should have moved the {}, the other would say:
